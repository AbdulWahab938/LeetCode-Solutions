Explanation:
-> Check each element of the array/list from the end to the beginning
-> If the value is less than 9, add one and return the array/list
-> Else set it to zero and continue the loop(since the adjacent number might be 9 as well)
-> If all the numbers are set to zero(meaning all were 9's in input array), insert 1 in the beginning of the array/list and return it
